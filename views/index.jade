							h4 About ASCE
							p Few years back the civil engineering department had a very active professional studentsâ€™ body CIVIL ENGINEERS ASSOCIATION. But due to some reasons the society ceased to make any useful contribution to the civil engineering department and was lost in oblivion. THE CEA was a very rich resource as it had almost all the technical experts of the region under its fold. There was a need felt by all professors as well as students to rejuvenate the chapter or start a similar body to cater to the requirements of a professional course. Hence the process to establish an ASCE chapter was initiated by the students and was wholeheartedly supported by the professors.
